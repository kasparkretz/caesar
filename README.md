# caesar
Kaspar's Caesar cipher experiment

My 7 year old son did not believe me that the Caesar cipher (shifting the alphabet by n positions) is not a secure way of encrypting data by modern standards. To convince him we programmed a litte Node application which executes a brute force attack on ciphertext encrypted using the Caesar cipher. The brute force procedure works uses a German word list and thus works for German cleartext. All prompts and output texts are in German.

## Install and run
